### Routes

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Query for the dates and temperature observations from the last year.

  * Convert the query results to a Dictionary using `date` as the key and `tobs` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

  * Return a JSON list of Temperature Observations (tobs) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.

## Hints

* You will need to join the station and measurement tables for some of the analysis queries.

* Use Flask `jsonify` to convert your API data into a valid JSON response object.

# 1. import Flask
from flask import Flask

# 2. Create an app, being sure to pass __name__
app = Flask(__name__)


# 3. Define what to do when a user hits the index route
@app.route("/api/v1.0/precipitation")
def home():
    print("Server received request for 'Home' page...")
    return "Welcome to my 'Home' page!"


# 4. Define what to do when a user hits the /about route
@app.route("/api/v1.0/tobs")
def about():
    print("Server received request for 'About' page...")
    return "Welcome to my 'About' page!"
